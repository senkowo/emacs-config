#+TITLE: Newmacs config

A modular Emacs config made for easy and flexible end-user configuration.

It is separated into different modules, separated by file.

Designed with speed, modularity, and minimalism in mind, it makes reducing your config to only the bare minimum easy.

This project is still very incomplete and under active development.
